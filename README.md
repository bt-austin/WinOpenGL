# WinOpenGL - OpenGL Program using the Win32 API
This is a pretty simple OpenGL 3.3 core program that draws a triangle to the screen
without using any external libraries. This program is only native to Windows,
so anyone using Linux/Mac will not be able to build.

## BUILDING

To build the project, you just need to open the solution file, and build the variant of the program
that you want to do (either x86, or x64).
